# Progress and next task

## Current state

- Product: ProfitLab, a local SEC earnings-growth research experiment.
- Implementation status: T08 complete locally; inspectable relevance screening, structural safeguards, bounded coverage recovery and immutable cached judgments.
- Next task: **T09 — Candidate extraction with source validation.**
- Latest verified task: T08 local acceptance and bounded live Jev spot check; visual inspection remains pending.
- Last runnable demo: `demo-t08-v2` (sources/chunks, fixture-backed probes and screening decisions). Earlier demos remain readable.
- Decisions: Python + uv; Pydantic; Pydantic AI; configurable OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions provider; separate Jev API; FastAPI/Jinja local UI; local artifacts and SQLite.
- Scope: up to four fiscal years of 10-Ks; common-share earnings and diluted EPS, with supporting share-count information. Actual investment return is outside this version.
- Current external blockers: browser visual inspection lacks Computer Use permissions. Live Jev and LLM compatibility probes passed after the follow-up fixes; SEC discovery/download checks remain recorded below.

## Task tracker

Use `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`, or `BLOCKED`. Keep local acceptance and live verification separate. Initially no check has run.

## Instruction for the implementing agent

1. Read this file and the relevant specification before editing.
2. Select the first TODO task whose dependencies are DONE. Resume an IN_PROGRESS task first.
3. Announce the task and its user-visible result. Implement only that bounded task and necessary fixes.
4. Use `uv` for dependencies, scripts, and tests. Preserve `uv.lock`.
5. Run the task's automated checks and its offline demo. Inspect its browser page when browser tooling is available; otherwise record that visual verification remains unrun.
6. Record actual commands, results, artifact/run IDs, and limitations below. Never invent a successful live call or browser inspection.
7. Mark DONE only when the local acceptance criteria pass. A blocked external check stays visibly pending, and compatible later offline work may continue.
8. Stop after the task. Tell the user what to open, what to click, what they should see, and the next task ID.

## Latest task handoff

Task: T08 — Jev relevance screening and coverage recovery.
Implemented: five complete, versioned Noul questions sent together per chunk,
separate excerpt/metadata/source instructions, typed persisted ScreeningDecisions,
experimental configurable thresholds, explicit structural table overrides retaining
original probabilities, and one bounded label/neighbor recovery pass with lineage.
Retained candidate coverage is filing/report-end-year/metric scoped and uses unique
primary source identities; it is not extracted numeric fact coverage. No global top-k.
Failed/unknown answers remain retained and never become successful cache entries.
Limits, omitted chunks and missing label coverage produce a partial stage.

Caches hash source/chunk/prompt contents, endpoint/model, fixture mode and policy.
Original calls and returned models survive reuse; latest aliases disclose uncertainty.
Immutable snapshots preserve prior judgments and recovery decisions. The inspector
shows the latest selection, all five score links, decision/reasons, override/recovery,
coverage, retained text totals, unique blocks/cells and historical/new-request usage.
Other chunks in a subset remain explicitly unknown. CLI adds screen, --max-chunks
and repeatable --chunk-id; no provider substitution. Nested live adapter/HTTP events
use stage=screen (probe remains the default for existing callers).

Commands/results:
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t08.py`: 3 passed. Offline gate forbids socket
  connections and covers real persisted service/UI, all decisions, unchanged low
  table scores, overlap deduplication, recovery, unknown/malformed/failed responses,
  request limits, cache reuse and source/prompt/model/endpoint/policy invalidation,
  alias uncertainty, restart persistence and configured-secret redaction.
- `uv run pytest`: 51 passed (before final bounded selection/tracing additions).
- Final `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t08.py tests/task_gates/test_t07.py`:
  11 passed after those additions; existing upstream Starlette/AnyIO warning only.
- `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T08 --run-id demo-t08`: passed, 57 fixture
  evaluations; 7 ordinary keeps, 5 structural keeps, 5 uncertain, 40 drops.
- Final `uv run profitlab demo --through T08 --run-id demo-t08-v2`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab stage live-sec-t04 chunk --filing-id filing-000032019325000079`:
  passed; 135 chunks from the saved Apple 2025 10-K.
- `uv run profitlab stage live-sec-t04 screen --filing-id filing-000032019325000079 --max-chunks 5`:
  passed as a partial subset; five low-scored cover-material chunks, five actual
  requests, 3,938 input/445 output tokens, returned model jev-1.13.0.
- `uv run profitlab stage live-sec-t04 screen --filing-id filing-000032019325000079 --chunk-id chunk-cf12f77b4bf34bd2079bd083 --chunk-id chunk-b3adc82acbe89d50f942a5fe --chunk-id chunk-2211585aba51a1891c3557e4`:
  partial subset as intended, two new requests plus one cache hit; new usage
  2,099 input/178 output tokens. Cover dropped (maximum 0.04); income/EPS table
  retained (income 0.99, EPS 0.98, shares 0.95); EPS note retained (0.98 for all
  three metrics). Returned model jev-1.13.0. Exact saved text and typed answers
  inspected in persisted artifacts; this is a spot check, not an accuracy benchmark.
- `uv run profitlab serve`: running at localhost:8000. Escalated localhost HTTP
  checks passed /health and /runs/demo-t08/chunks with visible screening markup.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t08-v2/chunks. Compare the annual EPS table,
uncertain management explanation, dropped prose and low-scored diluted-share table
with Structural override. Click a probability to open the exact call in Trace.
Real sample: http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/live-sec-t04/chunks (only three selected
chunks have current results; all others unknown, stage visibly partial).

Visual verification unrun: CUA inventory has no browser connectors; Safari returned
“Computer Use was not approved to use Safari.” HTTP checks are not visual inspection.
No dependency/lockfile changes. UTF-8 estimates and safety budgets remain provisional;
fixture scores are explicitly labeled and never presented as measured Jev behavior.
Recovery performs label/neighbor retention using existing answers rather than a
second inference pass; its original-to-recovered decision lineage is traced.
Changed chunk configurations remain separate immutable inputs; choosing a pipeline
configuration across versions belongs to T13. Next task: T09.

## T07 task handoff

Task: T07 — Jev and OpenAI-compatible provider adapters.
Implemented: separate live/fake Jev Noul clients and typed request/response/usage
contracts; explicit configured OpenAIChatModel/OpenAIProvider factory using the
installed Pydantic AI 2.44.0 API and OpenAI SDK 3.14.1. Compatibility agent calls
the harmless local read_probe tool exactly once and validates its returned marker.
The fixture uses the actual agent framework with FunctionModel, not a scripted
conversation. Configured URL/model/output mode are honored without fallback.
A shared transport owns bounded retries; SDK transport retries are disabled.
Jev 429/529 and transient errors back off; authentication, validation and LLM
exhausted quota stop immediately. Structured-output repairs are tracked separately.
Requests/full responses, actual returned models, usage, native message snapshots,
tool call IDs, validation feedback and interrupted histories persist redacted.
Doctor live probes share the service and print a trace URL even on failure.

Commands/results:
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t07.py`: five-test gate passed at initial handoff; follow-up full suite covers eight T07 tests. Gate covers full T07 offline progression
  with socket connections forbidden and absent keys, fake transport retries,
  auth/validation/quota errors, malformed probabilities/IDs/output, custom URL/model,
  actual SDK Chat Completions requests, real agent tools, independent repair budgets,
  native history round-trip, cancellation, persisted/exported secret redaction and UI.
- `uv run pytest`: 48 passed after follow-up fixes; existing Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning.
  Updated obsolete T01 invalid-input examples to T08/unknown provider so automated
  checks no longer invoke newly supported live commands.
- `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T07 --run-id demo-t07-v3`: passed.
  Earlier `demo-t07` retained a failed initial usage-serialization attempt;
  `demo-t07-v2` and final v3 are successful and remain inspectable.
- `uv run profitlab doctor --live jev`: passed, `probe-jev-898d593055c2`;
  returned model jev-1.13.0, 311 input/20 output tokens, one HTTP 200 request.
- `uv run profitlab doctor --live llm`: failed, `probe-llm-51ceec570bc0`;
  three HTTP 429 insufficient_quota/credit_balance_exhausted responses.
  Added nonretryable exhausted-quota classification based on this observed response.
- User added LLM credits; `doctor --live llm` retried as `probe-llm-da62f895dc55`;
  still HTTP 429 insufficient_quota, now stops after one request. Final delayed
  retry `probe-llm-f36f7dcc9a8f` also returned exhausted quota on one request.
- `uv run profitlab serve`: running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t07-v3/trace. Expand fake-jev to see the
state/question fixture and fixture-jev-1 response. Expand Fixture agent history
or filter kind=conversation, then Full result JSON to inspect native tool calls,
returns and typed marker. Actor=agent_tool shows the actual framework-dispatched
read_probe call. Live Jev and failed LLM runs have their own trace URLs.

Visual inspection unrun: CUA inventory returned no browser connectors; selecting
native Safari returned “Computer Use permissions are not granted.” HTTP acceptance
is not visual inspection. Live LLM tool/schema capabilities passed in `probe-llm-516a2123c5de` after
reasoning-effort, decompression and Decimal-serialization fixes (details below). No silent
provider substitution and no invented live agent/tool conversation. Probe success
is not a financial accuracy or screening benchmark. Jev supports only the Noul
primitive required for T08; other TypeSafe primitives are outside this slice.
Native JSON-schema output mode is explicit; live mode compatibility is not assumed.
Probe budgets: 30-second requests, 120-second total, three HTTP attempts, one
structured repair, four model requests, two tool calls, 2MB HTTP response cap.
Fixture framework token estimates are labeled and separate from provider usage.
No dependencies or lockfile changes. Next task: T08.

## T06 task handoff

Task: T06 — Table-aware chunking and chunk inspector.
Implemented: deterministic filing-scoped blocks-1 chunker, configurable 1500/180
prose target/whole-block overlap, table context, intact tables beyond target,
row-group splitting under a separate safe request budget, repeated multi-level
headers/units/captions, rowspan-connected row groups, explicit oversized errors.
Chunks persist content hashes, primary/overlap/context blocks, cell identities,
source anchors, estimator identity and full request estimates. Versioned immutable
indexes include source hash and parser version. CLI `stage <run-id> chunk` and
T06 demo use the same service; traces preserve requests/results and failures.
The inspector filters filing/heading/size and links preceding/following chunks
and saved source blocks. No fabricated screening scores or provider usage.

Commands/results:
- `uv run pytest`: 40 passed, one existing Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning.
- T06 gate: two acceptance tests covering complete block/cell coverage, repeated
  hashes, source scope, intact/split tables, header/unit context, overlap, request
  limits, unsupported rows, idempotent progression, persistence and HTTP filters.
- `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T06 --run-id demo-t06`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab serve`: local server on localhost:8000.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t06/chunks. Filter heading to
“Chunk boundary examples”, inspect prose overlap, the intact 160-row table, and
pieces of the 1,800-row table. Follow Primary blocks to the saved original table;
Following chunk advances with repeated annual year/unit headers. Synthetic values
are illustrative, not extraction expectations.

Visual inspection unrun: CUA inventory had no browser connector; native Safari
returned “Computer Use permissions are not granted.” HTTP checks do not constitute
visual verification. No live services or paid calls used. UTF-8 bytes/3 estimates
and 24,000-token budget with 2,000 reserved overhead are conservative provisional
proxies, not a verified Jev tokenizer or provider ceiling. Full oversized prose
blocks fail explicitly; header layouts without usable context also fail visibly.
Whole-block overlap may be smaller than 180. Multiple immutable configurations
remain visible in the inspector; future pipeline selection belongs to T13.
Dependencies and uv.lock unchanged. Next task: T07.

## T05 task handoff

Task: T05 — Filing downloads and anchored source viewer.
Implemented: controlled `stage <run-id> download|parse` with optional `--filing-id`,
shared SEC limiter and retry owner, one active in-process live SEC operation,
HTML/content/closing-document validation, byte/time limits, and immutable raw
source bytes. Typed source metadata stores hash, bytes, status, URL, content type
and retrieval time. Cache reuse checks metadata/source hashes; failures persist
with exact stage/error and remain visible in Sources and Trace. Initial discovery
filing contracts are preserved; fetch metadata is authoritative in `source-*`
artifacts. Successful stages publish immutable manifest snapshots.

Parser `html-2` preserves visible headings, paragraphs, div-based SEC prose,
captions, footnotes, merged table spans and inline-XBRL IDs. Blocks/cells have
repeatable IDs, DOM locators, header/year/unit associations and original anchors
only when an explicit DOM ID/name exists. Table expansion is bounded. Quotes use
Unicode-whitespace collapse, preserving case/punctuation and raw stored text.
Versioned parsed indexes retain previous derivatives. The viewer uses escaped
text and reconstructed tables, with exact-cell or span-aware row/column
highlighting; no raw HTML is marked safe. Printed page labels remain unknown
rather than inferred. Source pages are run-index scoped, with accession/date/hash,
section paths, local anchors and genuine SEC links; demos have synthetic badges.

Commands/results:
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t05.py`: gate passed; final gate has seven
  tests covering full offline service/UI, stable IDs, spans/header IDs, exact
  highlights, quote normalization, scripts, traversal, raw preservation, malformed
  HTML/PDF/403, disconnect retry, byte limits, persistence/cache reuse and errors.
- Final `uv run pytest`: 38 passed; existing upstream Starlette/AnyIO warning.
- Final `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T05 --run-id demo-t05`: passed initial parser.
- Final versioned demo: `uv run profitlab demo --through T05 --run-id demo-t05-v2`.
- `uv run profitlab stage live-sec-t04 download --filing-id filing-000032019325000079`:
  passed using configured SEC contact; raw Apple 2025 10-K and provenance saved.
- `uv run profitlab stage live-sec-t04 parse --filing-id filing-000032019325000079`:
  passed. Real div-based prose prompted necessary parser support; final result
  has 698 visible blocks, 6,379 cells, 105 original block anchors. All 105 anchors
  were checked against raw DOM IDs/names. EPS tables include original anchors
  `f-72` and `f-410`; this is DOM verification, not a browser scroll check.
- Local server started/restarted with `uv run profitlab serve`, localhost:8000.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t05-v2/sources. Choose the annual income table,
then click its EPS value for one-cell highlight; Row + column includes the label
and year. The edge-case table has merged headers and neighboring years. Open
http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/live-sec-t04/sources for the saved real 2025 filing;
other discovered live filings remain pending download.

Visual inspection remains unrun: CUA inventory had no browser connector; native
Safari returned “Computer Use permissions are not granted.” Original SEC anchor
existence is verified in saved bytes, but navigation/scrolling on the SEC original
is pending. Parser verification is a one-filing smoke check, not a general accuracy
claim. Hidden facts are excluded from this visible-source parser; extraction of
structured contexts/transformations belongs to T09. Download cache reuse currently
uses per-run immutable artifacts; cross-run archive deduplication is deferred.
Dependencies/uv.lock unchanged. uv commands required existing-cache escalation.
Next task: T06.

## T04 task handoff

Task: T04 — SEC ticker lookup and annual filing discovery.
Implemented: typed httpx SEC client, shared disk rate limiter across local threads
and processes, declared contact identity, bounded per-request/total timeouts,
response bytes, historical-file traversal and one retry owner. Validated atomic
JSON caches include retrieval timestamps and hashes (24h ticker/1h submissions).
All requests, responses, failures, retries and cache hits have complete redacted
trace payloads. Ticker normalization trims/uppercases and maps class dots to
hyphens without fuzzy matching. Resolution distinguishes not_found, ambiguous,
unsupported and service_error. Annual selection deduplicates accession/report
period, excludes quarterlies, traverses both recent and historical array shapes,
and retains amendments without consuming annual slots. Both accession formats
are stored. Original SEC URLs are constructed from validated metadata; synthetic
sources use explicit badges. Home discovery form and CLI stop at discovery.
One live operation at a time is enforced within the local app; the disk limiter
also coordinates separate CLI processes using the same data directory.

Immutable initial manifests remain intact; discovery publishes a validated
`manifest-discovery` snapshot that repository readers prefer. Historical-file or
request limits report incomplete service failure, never not-found. Two-year
coverage is partial and does not fabricate additional years.

Commands/results:
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t04.py`: initial gate caught a missing test
  import; fixed before final acceptance. Expanded gate covers retry recovery,
  redaction on success/failure, corrupt cache, malformed arrays/history, identity
  mismatch, byte/history/time limits, cache persistence and all lookup outcomes.
- Final `uv run pytest`: 31 passed; one upstream Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning.
- Final `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T04 --run-id demo-t04`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T04 --scenario two-years --run-id two-years-t04`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab doctor --live sec`: passed; run `discover-e09052541481`.
- `uv run profitlab discover AAPL --years 4 --mode live --run-id live-sec-t04`:
  passed; Apple Inc., CIK 0000320193, four distinct report periods 2022–2025.
- `uv run profitlab serve`: server available on localhost:8000.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t04 to inspect the company, four annual
periods and amendment; open `/runs/two-years-t04` to see two periods. Home →
Synthetic demo → UNKNOWN gives not_found; TIMEOUT gives service_error. Trace
shows actual adapter requests, including the fixture older-history file. Live
run: http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/live-sec-t04 (SEC original links and cached request
payloads). Filing downloads, source inspection and financial processing await T05+.

Visual check remains unrun: CUA inventory has no browser connector, and native
Safari returned “Computer Use permissions are not granted.” HTTP acceptance is
not represented as visual verification. Dependencies/uv.lock unchanged. Some uv
commands needed escalation to read the existing uv cache. Next task: T05.

## Previous task handoff

Task: T03 — Persistent trace recorder and trace viewer.
Implemented: append-only fsynced JSONL trace, run-scoped process locks and ordered
sequence allocation, content-addressed immutable payloads, context-local nested
spans, shared call IDs across attempts, service/tool operation wrapper, duration,
errors and BaseException/cancellation closure. Server startup reconciles open spans
as interrupted; malformed final lines remain on disk with a visible warning and
usable earlier history. Shared redaction handles configured secrets, sensitive
keys/headers, bearer tokens, URL credentials and query tokens before persistence.
Added filtered timeline, one-expansion full request/result loading, standalone
payload JSON/viewer links, copy event JSON, payload/ID search, incremental event
endpoint/polling notification and trace-only JSON/JSONL export. No fabricated model
conversation; scripted operations are labeled pipeline and Synthetic demo.

Commands executed and results:
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t01.py tests/task_gates/test_t02.py`: 10 passed.
- `uv run pytest tests/task_gates/test_t03.py`: initially caught a secret echoed in
  the tool label; fixed metadata redaction, then complete suite passed.
- `uv run profitlab demo --through T03 --run-id demo-t03`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab export demo-t03 --output ./exports/demo-t03`: passed; complete
  payloads exported alongside trace.json and events.jsonl.
- Final `uv run pytest`: 13 passed, one upstream Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning.
- Final `uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `uv run profitlab serve`: started, then stopped and restarted with final changes;
  server left running at localhost:8000.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/demo-t03/trace. Expand the failed fixture request,
inspect full arguments/error, and follow its call ID to attempt 2. Expand fixture
read to see the full large result or use Full result JSON/viewer. Refresh preserves
history. Export directory: exports/demo-t03 (ignored runtime output).
Automated gate checks concurrent recorder instances (80 uniquely ordered events),
matching start/end IDs and nested parentage, startup recovery after a truncated
journal tail, cancellation closure, filters, full large payload retrieval, run
scoping, HTML escaping, restart persistence, overwrite refusal and credential scans
across all saved/exported artifacts. Earlier invalid-future CLI gate now uses T04.
Browser checks: CUA inventory contains no browser connector; native Safari returned
“Computer Use permissions are not granted.” Visual expansion/copy/polling checks
remain unrun; HTTP checks are not claimed as visual inspection.
Live checks: not applicable; no external service calls or paid model requests.
Limitations: trace-only export; actual agent conversation hooks start in T07/T12.
Polling announces new matching events with a refresh link. Restart reconciliation
assumes the specified single local server and stopped application workers; it does
not infer remote completion or retry interrupted calls. Future integrations must
pass Settings.redactor() and use the recorder instead of logging raw failures.
Dependencies and uv.lock unchanged. uv commands required escalation for the existing
cache. Next task: T04.

## Durable decisions / deviations

- User preference: default generative provider is OpenAI API at `https://api.openai.com/v1`,
  model `gpt-5.6-luna` for low cost. Set `LLM_API_KEY` locally. Base URL/model
  remain overrideable. Official model docs verified 2026-09-17; live quality and
  account access remain untested until T07. Settings, example, specification and
  README updated; T01 gate and Ruff rerun successfully.

- Planning baseline dated 2026-09-17. Dependency versions must be selected, recorded, and locked in T01; no untested version numbers are prescribed.
- Chunk default: approximately 1,500 tokens with 180-token prose overlap, subject to T14 evaluation.
- Full trace means observable messages, prompts, tool arguments/results, model outputs, service requests, and explicit decisions. It does not imply access to a model's private reasoning.

## Live verification ledger

Add date, provider, actual model ID, command, run ID, outcome, and unresolved issue for each live check. Never store credentials here.

- 2026-09-17, SEC public JSON API (no model): `doctor --live sec`, run
  `discover-e09052541481`, passed. AAPL resolved to Apple Inc./0000320193;
  report date 2025-09-27, accession 0000320193-25-000079. Ticker and submissions
  returned HTTP 200 with validated schemas; complete payloads are saved in trace.
- 2026-09-17, SEC: `discover AAPL --years 4 --mode live --run-id live-sec-t04`,
  passed using the validated live-response cache. Report dates: 2025-09-27,
  2024-09-28, 2023-09-30, 2022-09-24. No filing downloads or original-anchor
  verification claimed; those are T05. No Jev or LLM calls made.

- 2026-09-17, SEC archive HTML (no model): T05 controlled download/parse on
  `live-sec-t04`, Apple 2025 10-K accession 0000320193-25-000079, passed. Exact raw
  bytes/provenance and html-2 block/cell artifacts saved. All 105 mapped DOM anchors
  exist; visual original-anchor scrolling remains pending due to CUA permissions.

- 2026-09-17, TypeSafe /v1/systemone: `doctor --live jev`, run
  `probe-jev-898d593055c2`, passed; actual model `jev-1.13.0`, HTTP 200,
  311 input/20 output tokens. Typed Noul answer validated; no screening benchmark.
- 2026-09-17, configured OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, requested model
  `gpt-5.6-luna`: `doctor --live llm`, run `probe-llm-51ceec570bc0`, failed
  with HTTP 429 `insufficient_quota` / `credit_balance_exhausted` on three attempts.
  No actual returned model, tool call or typed output; native partial history saved.
- 2026-09-17, same configured LLM after user added credits: `doctor --live llm`,
  run `probe-llm-da62f895dc55`, still HTTP 429 exhausted quota on one request.
  Tool/typed-output live verification remains pending; account/key billing state
  may need propagation or correction. No credential values recorded.

- 2026-09-17, final delayed LLM retry after credit update, `doctor --live llm`,
  run `probe-llm-f36f7dcc9a8f`, HTTP 429 exhausted quota again, one request.
  Live tool/schema compatibility remains unverified. Local acceptance is complete.

## T07 follow-up — Live Chat Completions compatibility

User live run `probe-llm-86c3afb529cb` returned HTTP 400: function tools with
reasoning are unsupported for gpt-5.6-luna in Chat Completions; the API instructed
using Responses or reasoning_effort=none. Kept the specified Chat Completions
adapter and model, and explicitly set none for this model on api.openai.com when
not otherwise configured. Added overrideable LLM_REASONING_EFFORT and traced the
effective model settings. Other models/endpoints get no automatic reasoning setting.
Official model docs confirm none is supported; endpoint/tool restriction is based
on the observed API error, rather than an inferred capability from the model page.

Run `probe-llm-4f0e938f2c0b` then received HTTP 200, returned model gpt-5.6-luna,
with a real requested read_probe call and usage of 173 prompt/13 completion tokens.
The call was not dispatched because the transport rebuilt a decoded response with
its original gzip header, causing httpx to decode it twice. Fixed by removing wire
content-encoding/content-length when rebuilding decoded responses, while retaining
original headers in trace payloads. Added regression checks for gzip responses,
explicit default reasoning, configured overrides and exact transmitted reasoning.

Final `doctor --live llm`, `probe-llm-e82b18c948e1`, again received HTTP 429
insufficient_quota/credit_balance_exhausted on its first request. The HTTP 400 and
double-decompression defects are fixed locally, but a complete live read-only tool
invocation plus validated typed response is still pending available account quota.
No successful live probe or tool invocation claimed. Dependencies/lockfile unchanged.

## T07 follow-up — Decimal usage serialization and successful live probe

User run `probe-llm-ee4d9ef3d9a8` received HTTP 200 but failed when recording
RunUsage.cost, which Pydantic AI represents as Decimal. Shared trace redaction
now converts Decimal to an exact string before JSON encoding, without conversion
to float or loss of precision. Added a FunctionModel regression with explicit
Decimal usage costs checking completed tool/typed-output flow, snapshots and
exported payloads. Framework cost values are estimates; native provider token
counts and raw usage remain separately inspectable.

`uv run profitlab doctor --live llm`: PASSED, `probe-llm-516a2123c5de`.
Two HTTP 200 Chat Completions requests, actual model gpt-5.6-luna in both responses;
173/13 then 203/22 prompt/completion tokens (376 input, 35 output total).
Exactly one real framework-dispatched read_probe call,
call_vFjFqb120qxgmQScLuK1ELMg, completed with matching call IDs. Final typed output
value=profitlab-probe-v1; zero structured-output repairs. Native observable message
history, request bodies, raw responses and usage persisted successfully.
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/runs/probe-llm-516a2123c5de/trace and filter
actor=agent_tool for the tool, or kind=conversation for native messages.
Visual verification remains pending; successful live compatibility is not a
financial extraction/quality benchmark. No dependencies or lockfile changes.
`uv run pytest`: 48 passed; existing Starlette/AnyIO warning.
`uv run ruff check .` and `git diff --check`: passed. Next task remains T08.

- 2026-09-17, OpenAI Chat Completions, `doctor --live llm`, run
  `probe-llm-516a2123c5de`, PASSED with actual model gpt-5.6-luna, two HTTP 200
  responses, one executed read-only tool and validated typed marker. Native history
  persisted; 376 input/35 output tokens total, no repairs. Earlier quota and local
  compatibility failures remain saved and are historical, not current blockers.

- 2026-09-17, TypeSafe screening on saved Apple 2025 10-K, `live-sec-t04`:
  bounded five-cover-chunk sample and three-chunk relevant/irrelevant comparison,
  seven new requests total, 6,037 input/623 output tokens, actual model jev-1.13.0.
  Typed responses validated; relevant table/note retained, cover dropped. Subset
  remains partial; visual inspection pending. No screening-accuracy claim.
